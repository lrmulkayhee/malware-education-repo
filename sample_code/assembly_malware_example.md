# Assembly Malware Example

## Explanation

This assembly program demonstrates basic malware-like behavior by writing a message to a file. The program performs the following steps:

1. **Data Section**:
    - `filename`: The name of the file to write to.
    - `message`: The message to write to the file.
    - `msg_len`: The length of the message.

2. **BSS Section**:
    - `file_descriptor`: A variable to store the file descriptor.

3. **Text Section**:
    - `_start`: The entry point of the program.
    - **Open the file**: Uses the `sys_open` system call to open the file for writing.
    - **Write the message**: Uses the `sys_write` system call to write the message to the file.
    - **Close the file**: Uses the `sys_close` system call to close the file.
    - **Exit the program**: Uses the `sys_exit` system call to exit the program.

## Assembling and Running the Program

To assemble and run this program on a Linux system, follow these steps:

1. **Save the code**: Save the code to a file named `assembly_malware_example.asm`.

2. **Assemble the code**: Use `nasm` to assemble the code into an object file.
    ```sh
    nasm -f elf32 assembly_malware_example.asm -o assembly_malware_example.o
    ```

3. **Link the object file**: Use `ld` to link the object file into an executable.
    ```sh
    ld -m elf_i386 assembly_malware_example.o -o assembly_malware_example
    ```

4. **Run the executable**: Run the resulting executable.
    ```sh
    ./assembly_malware_example
    ```

5. **Check the output**: Verify that the `output.txt` file has been created and contains the message.
    ```sh
    cat output.txt
    ```
