# Virus Education Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to educating about viruses, their types, how they are made, how they attack, and what we can do to prevent them.

## Types of Viruses

1. **File Infector Virus**: Attaches itself to executable files and spreads to other executables when the infected program is run.
2. **Macro Virus**: Targets applications like Microsoft Word or Excel, embedding malicious code in documents.
3. **Boot Sector Virus**: Infects the master boot record of a hard drive, making it difficult to remove.
4. **Polymorphic Virus**: Changes its code each time it spreads to avoid detection.
5. **Metamorphic Virus**: Rewrites its own code and appears differently each time it infects a system.

## How Viruses Are Made

Viruses are typically created using programming languages such as C, C++, Python, or assembly language. They exploit vulnerabilities in software or operating systems to spread and execute malicious activities.

## How Viruses Attack

1. **Replication**: The virus replicates itself to spread to other files or systems.
2. **Payload Delivery**: Executes malicious activities such as data corruption, stealing information, or creating backdoors.
3. **Trigger**: Some viruses remain dormant until a specific condition is met, such as a date or action.

## Prevention Methods

1. **Use Antivirus Software**: Regularly update and scan your system with reliable antivirus software.
2. **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure all software, including the operating system, is up to date with the latest security patches.
3. **Avoid Suspicious Links and Attachments**: Do not open email attachments or click on links from unknown sources.
4. **Use Firewalls**: Enable firewalls to block unauthorized access to your system.
5. **Backup Data**: Regularly backup important data to recover in case of an infection.
