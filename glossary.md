# Glossary

Welcome to the [Project Name] glossary! This document provides definitions and explanations of terms and concepts used throughout the project, specifically related to computer viruses and cybersecurity.

## A

### Antivirus Software
A program designed to detect and remove malware, including computer viruses.

**Example**: Installing antivirus software can help protect your computer from malicious attacks.

## B

### Boot Sector Virus
A type of computer virus that infects the boot sector of a storage device, making it difficult to remove.

**Example**: Boot sector viruses can prevent a computer from starting up properly.

## C

### Computer Virus
A type of malicious software that attaches itself to a host file and can replicate and spread to other files and systems.

**Example**: A computer virus can corrupt files and disrupt system operations.

## D

### Drive-by Download
A method by which a computer virus or malware is automatically downloaded and installed when a user visits a compromised website.

**Example**: Drive-by downloads can infect your computer without your knowledge.

## E

### Email Virus
A type of computer virus that spreads through email attachments or links.

**Example**: Opening an infected email attachment can introduce an email virus to your system.

## F

### File Infector Virus
A type of computer virus that attaches itself to executable files and spreads when the infected file is run.

**Example**: File infector viruses can corrupt or delete files on your computer.

## G

### Grayware
Software that is not outright malicious but can be annoying or harmful, such as adware or spyware.

**Example**: Grayware can slow down your computer and compromise your privacy.

## H

### Heuristic Analysis
A method used by antivirus software to detect new, unknown viruses by analyzing their behavior.

**Example**: Heuristic analysis can identify potential threats based on suspicious activity.

## I

### Infected File
A file that has been compromised by a computer virus or malware.

**Example**: Running an infected file can spread the virus to other parts of your system.

## J

### Junk Email
Unsolicited and often irrelevant or inappropriate email, also known as spam.

**Example**: Junk email can contain links to malicious websites or attachments.

## K

### Keylogger
A type of malware that records keystrokes to capture sensitive information such as passwords.

**Example**: Keyloggers can steal your personal information without your knowledge.

## L

### Logic Bomb
A piece of code intentionally inserted into software that will set off a malicious function when certain conditions are met.

**Example**: A logic bomb can delete files or corrupt data when triggered.

## M

### Malware
Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise a computer system.

**Example**: Malware can include viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware.

## N

### Network Virus
A type of computer virus that spreads through network connections.

**Example**: Network viruses can infect multiple computers connected to the same network.

## O

### Overwriting Virus
A type of computer virus that overwrites the content of a file, making it irrecoverable.

**Example**: Overwriting viruses can destroy important data on your computer.

## P

### Payload
The part of a computer virus that performs the malicious action.

**Example**: The payload of a virus can delete files or steal personal information.

## Q

### Quarantine (Computer Security)
The process of isolating infected files to prevent the spread of malware.

**Example**: Antivirus software can quarantine suspicious files to protect your system.

## R

### Ransomware
A type of malware that encrypts a user's files and demands payment to restore access.

**Example**: Ransomware attacks can lock you out of your own data until you pay a ransom.

## S

### Spyware
Malware that secretly monitors and collects information about a user's activities.

**Example**: Spyware can track your browsing habits and steal personal information.

### Trojan Horse
A type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program to trick users into installing it.

**Example**: A trojan horse can create backdoors in your system for other malware to enter.

## U

### Update
A software patch that fixes vulnerabilities and improves security.

**Example**: Regular updates can protect your system from new threats.

## V

### Virus Signature
A unique string of code that can be used to identify a specific virus.

**Example**: Antivirus software uses virus signatures to detect and remove malware.

## W

### Worm
A type of malware that replicates itself to spread to other computers.

**Example**: Worms can spread rapidly across networks, causing widespread damage.

## X

### XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

**Example**: The API can return data in XML format.

## Y

### YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
A human-readable data serialization standard that can be used in conjunction with all programming languages and is often used for configuration files.

**Example**: The project's configuration is stored in a YAML file.

## Z

### Zero-Day Exploit
A vulnerability in software that is exploited by attackers before the developer has released a fix.

**Example**: Zero-day exploits can be particularly dangerous because they are unknown to the software vendor.
