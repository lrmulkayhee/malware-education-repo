# Incident Response Exercise

## Objective
Simulate an incident response scenario to practice detecting, containing, and mitigating a malware incident.

## Instructions
1. **Scenario Setup**: Assume that a malware infection has been detected on a corporate network. Your task is to respond to the incident following the incident response lifecycle.

2. **Preparation**: Review the incident response plan and ensure all team members are aware of their roles and responsibilities.

3. **Detection and Analysis**: Use monitoring tools to detect and analyze the malware.
   - Identify the malware and assess its impact.
   - Tools: Process Monitor, Wireshark, antivirus software.

4. **Containment**: Implement containment strategies to prevent the spread of the malware.
   - Isolate infected systems from the network.
   - Implement temporary controls such as firewalls and access restrictions.

5. **Eradication**: Remove the malware from infected systems.
   - Use antivirus software and manual removal techniques.
   - Clean up any remaining artifacts.

6. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operations.
   - Use backups to restore data.
   - Verify the integrity of restored systems.

7. **Post-Incident Activities**: Document the incident and response actions.
   - Create a report detailing the incident, response actions, and lessons learned.
   - Provide recommendations for improving future responses.

## Deliverables
- A report detailing the incident response actions and findings.
- Screenshots of the tools and results.
