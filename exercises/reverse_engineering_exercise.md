# Reverse Engineering Exercise

## Objective
Perform reverse engineering on a provided malware sample to understand its structure, functionality, and behavior.

## Instructions
1. **Download the Malware Sample**: Obtain the provided malware sample from the link below.
   - [Download Sample](#)

2. **Disassemble the Code**: Use a disassembler like IDA Pro or Ghidra to analyze the code structure.
   - Identify the entry point and main functions.
   - Look for suspicious API calls and strings.

3. **Analyze the Assembly Code**: Familiarize yourself with common assembly instructions and their meanings.
   - Learn about registers, stack operations, and control flow instructions.

4. **Identify Key Functions**: Locate and analyze key functions within the disassembled code.
   - Look for patterns and common malware behaviors.

5. **Document Findings**: Create a report summarizing your findings, including identified functions, API calls, and any obfuscation techniques.

## Deliverables
- A report detailing your findings from the reverse engineering analysis.
- Screenshots of the tools and results.
