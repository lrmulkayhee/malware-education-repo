# Static Analysis Exercise

## Objective
Perform static analysis on a provided malware sample to identify its characteristics and functionality without executing it.

## Instructions
1. **Download the Malware Sample**: Obtain the provided malware sample from the link below.
   - [Download Sample](#)

2. **File Properties**: Use tools like `file` and `md5sum` to check the basic properties of the file.
   - Command:
     ```sh
     file sample.exe
     md5sum sample.exe
     ```

3. **VirusTotal Scan**: Upload the file to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and review the results.

4. **Extract Strings**: Use the `strings` tool to extract readable text from the binary.
   - Command:
     ```sh
     strings sample.exe > strings_output.txt
     ```

5. **Disassemble the Code**: Use a disassembler like IDA Pro or Ghidra to analyze the code structure.
   - Identify the entry point and main functions.
   - Look for suspicious API calls and strings.

6. **Analyze the PE Header**: Use tools like PEiD or PEview to inspect the Portable Executable (PE) header.
   - Check for unusual sections, imports, and exports.

7. **Document Findings**: Create a report summarizing your findings, including suspicious strings, API calls, and any identified obfuscation techniques.

## Deliverables
- A report detailing your findings from the static analysis.
- Screenshots of the tools and results.
