# Identifying and Analyzing Malware Persistence Mechanisms

## Introduction
Persistence mechanisms allow malware to maintain a foothold on an infected system, ensuring it runs even after reboots or user logouts. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of identifying and analyzing these mechanisms using various tools.

## Requirements
- A safe analysis environment (refer to the "Setting Up a Safe Analysis Environment" tutorial)
- Malware sample (use a known harmless sample for practice)
- Tools: Autoruns, Process Monitor, Regshot, Task Scheduler

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the Environment
1. **Isolate the Virtual Machine**: Ensure the virtual machine is isolated from your main network.
2. **Take a Snapshot**: Take a snapshot of the clean state of your virtual machine to revert to it after analysis.

### 2. Monitor System Changes
1. **Autoruns**: Use Autoruns to check for any new startup entries created by the malware.
   - Run Autoruns before and after executing the malware to compare the state.

2. **Regshot**: Use Regshot to take a snapshot of the registry before and after executing the malware.
   - Compare the snapshots to identify changes made by the malware.

### 3. Execute the Malware
1. **Run the Malware**: Execute the malware in the isolated environment.
   - Observe any immediate changes or new processes.

### 4. Analyze Persistence Mechanisms
1. **Autoruns Analysis**: Review the Autoruns output to identify any new or modified startup entries.
   - Look for entries in common persistence locations (e.g., Run keys, startup folders).

2. **Registry Analysis**: Use Regshot to compare registry snapshots and identify changes.
   - Focus on common persistence-related keys (e.g., `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`).

3. **Task Scheduler**: Check for any new scheduled tasks created by the malware.
   - Use the Task Scheduler tool to review and analyze scheduled tasks.

### 5. Document Findings
1. **Create a Report**: Document your findings, including identified persistence mechanisms and their locations.
2. **Screenshots and Logs**: Include screenshots of the tools and logs from your analysis.

## Conclusion
Identifying and analyzing persistence mechanisms is crucial for understanding how malware maintains its presence on an infected system. By following these steps, you can safely identify and analyze these mechanisms in a controlled environment.
