# Behavioral Analysis of Malware

## Introduction
Behavioral analysis involves observing how malware interacts with the system, including file operations, network communications, and registry modifications. This method helps in understanding the impact and intent of the malware. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of performing behavioral analysis using various tools.

## Requirements
- A safe analysis environment (refer to the "Setting Up a Safe Analysis Environment" tutorial)
- Malware sample (use a known harmless sample for practice)
- Tools: Process Monitor, Wireshark, Autoruns, Process Explorer

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the Environment
1. **Isolate the Virtual Machine**: Ensure the virtual machine is isolated from your main network.
2. **Take a Snapshot**: Take a snapshot of the clean state of your virtual machine to revert to it after analysis.

### 2. Monitor System Activity
1. **Process Monitor**: Use Process Monitor to track file system, registry, and process/thread activity.
   - Start Process Monitor before executing the malware.
   - Filter the results to focus on the malware process.

2. **Autoruns**: Use Autoruns to check for any new startup entries created by the malware.
   - Compare the state before and after executing the malware.

### 3. Capture Network Traffic
1. **Wireshark**: Use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic generated by the malware.
   - Start Wireshark before executing the malware.
   - Filter the traffic to focus on the malware's network activity.

### 4. Execute the Malware
1. **Process Explorer**: Use Process Explorer to monitor the malware's process and its interactions with other processes.
   - Observe the behavior of the malware and note any suspicious activity.

### 5. Analyze the Results
1. **Process Monitor Logs**: Review the logs to identify file, registry, and process activities.
2. **Autoruns Comparison**: Analyze the startup entries to understand any persistence mechanisms.
3. **Wireshark Capture**: Examine the network traffic to identify any communication with external servers.
4. **Process Explorer Observations**: Note any unusual process behavior or interactions.

### 6. Document Findings
1. **Create a Report**: Document your findings, including system changes, network activity, and any identified malicious behavior.
2. **Screenshots and Logs**: Include screenshots of the tools and logs from your analysis.

## Conclusion
Behavioral analysis provides valuable insights into the interactions and impact of malware on a system. By following these steps, you can safely observe and analyze malware behavior in a controlled environment.
