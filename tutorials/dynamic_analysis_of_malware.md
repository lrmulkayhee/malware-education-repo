# Dynamic Analysis of Malware

## Introduction
Dynamic analysis involves executing malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior and interactions with the system. This method helps in understanding the real-time impact of the malware. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of performing dynamic analysis using various tools.

## Requirements
- A safe analysis environment (refer to the "Setting Up a Safe Analysis Environment" tutorial)
- Malware sample (use a known harmless sample for practice)
- Tools: Process Monitor, Wireshark, Regshot, Sandboxie

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the Environment
1. **Isolate the Virtual Machine**: Ensure the virtual machine is isolated from your main network.
2. **Take a Snapshot**: Take a snapshot of the clean state of your virtual machine to revert to it after analysis.

### 2. Monitor System Activity
1. **Process Monitor**: Use Process Monitor to track file system, registry, and process/thread activity.
   - Start Process Monitor before executing the malware.
   - Filter the results to focus on the malware process.

2. **Regshot**: Use Regshot to take a snapshot of the registry before and after executing the malware.
   - Compare the snapshots to identify changes made by the malware.

### 3. Capture Network Traffic
1. **Wireshark**: Use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic generated by the malware.
   - Start Wireshark before executing the malware.
   - Filter the traffic to focus on the malware's network activity.

### 4. Execute the Malware
1. **Sandboxie**: Use Sandboxie to run the malware in an isolated environment.
   - Observe the behavior of the malware and note any suspicious activity.

### 5. Analyze the Results
1. **Process Monitor Logs**: Review the logs to identify file, registry, and process activities.
2. **Regshot Comparison**: Analyze the registry changes to understand the impact on the system.
3. **Wireshark Capture**: Examine the network traffic to identify any communication with external servers.

### 6. Document Findings
1. **Create a Report**: Document your findings, including system changes, network activity, and any identified malicious behavior.
2. **Screenshots and Logs**: Include screenshots of the tools and logs from your analysis.

## Conclusion
Dynamic analysis provides valuable insights into the real-time behavior of malware. By following these steps, you can safely execute and analyze malware in a controlled environment.
