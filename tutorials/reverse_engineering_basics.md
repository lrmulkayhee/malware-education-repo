# Reverse Engineering Basics

## Introduction
Reverse engineering involves analyzing a compiled binary to understand its structure, functionality, and behavior. This method is crucial for understanding how malware operates and devising countermeasures. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of reverse engineering using various tools and techniques.

## Requirements
- A safe analysis environment (refer to the "Setting Up a Safe Analysis Environment" tutorial)
- Malware sample (use a known harmless sample for practice)
- Tools: IDA Pro, Ghidra, Radare2, Hex Editor, strings

## Steps

### 1. Initial Inspection
1. **File Properties**: Check the basic properties of the file (e.g., size, type, hashes).
   - On a terminal, use commands like `file` and `md5sum`:
     ```sh
     file sample.exe
     md5sum sample.exe
     ```

2. **VirusTotal Scan**: Upload the file to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) to get an initial assessment from multiple antivirus engines.

### 2. Extract Strings
1. **Strings Extraction**: Use the `strings` tool to extract readable text from the binary.
   - On a terminal:
     ```sh
     strings sample.exe > strings_output.txt
     ```
2. **Analyze Strings**: Look for URLs, IP addresses, file paths, and other suspicious strings.

### 3. Disassemble the Code
1. **IDA Pro/Ghidra/Radare2**: Open the malware sample in a disassembler to view the assembly code.
   - Identify the entry point and main functions.
   - Look for suspicious API calls (e.g., network functions, file operations).

### 4. Analyze the PE Header (for Windows Executables)
1. **PE Header Analysis**: Use tools like PEiD or PEview to inspect the Portable Executable (PE) header.
   - Check for unusual sections, imports, and exports.

### 5. Identify Obfuscation Techniques
1. **Obfuscation Detection**: Look for signs of obfuscation, such as packed sections or encrypted strings.
   - Use tools like UPX to check for common packers:
     ```sh
     upx -d sample.exe
     ```

### 6. Understand Assembly Code
1. **Basic Assembly Instructions**: Familiarize yourself with common assembly instructions and their meanings.
   - Learn about registers, stack operations, and control flow instructions.

2. **Function Analysis**: Identify and analyze key functions within the disassembled code.
   - Look for patterns and common malware behaviors.

### 7. Document Findings
1. **Create a Report**: Document your findings, including suspicious strings, API calls, and any identified obfuscation techniques.
2. **Screenshots and Logs**: Include screenshots of the disassembly and logs from your tools.

## Conclusion
Reverse engineering is a powerful technique for understanding the inner workings of malware. By following these steps, you can gain insights into the structure and functionality of malicious code.
