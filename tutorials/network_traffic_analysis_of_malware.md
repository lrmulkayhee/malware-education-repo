# Network Traffic Analysis of Malware

## Introduction
Network traffic analysis involves capturing and examining the network communications of malware to understand its behavior and identify any command-and-control (C2) servers it may be communicating with. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of performing network traffic analysis using various tools.

## Requirements
- A safe analysis environment (refer to the "Setting Up a Safe Analysis Environment" tutorial)
- Malware sample (use a known harmless sample for practice)
- Tools: Wireshark, Fiddler, TCPView

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the Environment
1. **Isolate the Virtual Machine**: Ensure the virtual machine is isolated from your main network.
2. **Take a Snapshot**: Take a snapshot of the clean state of your virtual machine to revert to it after analysis.

### 2. Capture Network Traffic
1. **Wireshark**: Use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic generated by the malware.
   - Start Wireshark before executing the malware.
   - Set up filters to focus on the malware's network activity (e.g., IP addresses, ports).

2. **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
   - Start Fiddler before executing the malware.
   - Analyze the captured traffic for any suspicious requests or responses.

### 3. Execute the Malware
1. **Run the Malware**: Execute the malware in the isolated environment.
   - Observe the network traffic generated by the malware in real-time.

### 4. Analyze the Network Traffic
1. **Wireshark Analysis**: Examine the captured packets in Wireshark.
   - Look for DNS queries, HTTP requests, and other network communications.
   - Identify any suspicious domains or IP addresses.

2. **Fiddler Analysis**: Review the HTTP/HTTPS traffic captured by Fiddler.
   - Look for unusual requests, data exfiltration, or C2 communication.

3. **TCPView**: Use TCPView to monitor active network connections.
   - Identify any new or suspicious connections established by the malware.

### 5. Document Findings
1. **Create a Report**: Document your findings, including suspicious domains, IP addresses, and network patterns.
2. **Screenshots and Logs**: Include screenshots of the tools and logs from your analysis.

## Conclusion
Network traffic analysis provides valuable insights into the communication patterns and potential C2 mechanisms of malware. By following these steps, you can safely capture and analyze network traffic generated by malware in a controlled environment.
