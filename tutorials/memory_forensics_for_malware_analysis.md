# Memory Forensics for Malware Analysis

## Introduction
Memory forensics involves capturing and analyzing the contents of a system's memory (RAM) to uncover hidden malware, understand its behavior, and identify any artifacts left in memory. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of performing memory forensics using various tools.

## Requirements
- A safe analysis environment (refer to the "Setting Up a Safe Analysis Environment" tutorial)
- Malware sample (use a known harmless sample for practice)
- Tools: Volatility, DumpIt, Process Hacker

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the Environment
1. **Isolate the Virtual Machine**: Ensure the virtual machine is isolated from your main network.
2. **Take a Snapshot**: Take a snapshot of the clean state of your virtual machine to revert to it after analysis.

### 2. Capture Memory Dump
1. **DumpIt**: Use DumpIt to capture a memory dump of the system.
   - Download and run DumpIt to create a memory dump file.
   - Save the memory dump file for analysis.

### 3. Analyze Memory Dump
1. **Volatility**: Use Volatility to analyze the memory dump.
   - Install Volatility and ensure it is configured correctly.
   - Run basic commands to get an overview of the memory dump:
     ```sh
     volatility -f memory.dmp imageinfo
     volatility -f memory.dmp pslist
     ```

2. **Process Analysis**: Identify and analyze suspicious processes.
   - Use commands like `pstree`, `dlllist`, and `handles` to gather more information about processes.
     ```sh
     volatility -f memory.dmp pstree
     volatility -f memory.dmp dlllist -p <PID>
     volatility -f memory.dmp handles -p <PID>
     ```

3. **Network Connections**: Check for network connections established by the malware.
   - Use the `netscan` command to list network connections.
     ```sh
     volatility -f memory.dmp netscan
     ```

4. **Extract Artifacts**: Extract any suspicious artifacts from memory.
   - Use commands like `filescan`, `dumpfiles`, and `malfind` to locate and extract artifacts.
     ```sh
     volatility -f memory.dmp filescan
     volatility -f memory.dmp dumpfiles -Q <OFFSET>
     volatility -f memory.dmp malfind
     ```

### 4. Document Findings
1. **Create a Report**: Document your findings, including identified processes, network connections, and extracted artifacts.
2. **Screenshots and Logs**: Include screenshots of the tools and logs from your analysis.

## Conclusion
Memory forensics provides valuable insights into the behavior and impact of malware by analyzing the contents of a system's memory. By following these steps, you can safely capture and analyze memory dumps in a controlled environment.
