# Analyzing Ransomware

## Introduction
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files and demands a ransom for their release. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of analyzing ransomware, including its encryption methods and ransom note delivery.

## Requirements
- A safe analysis environment (refer to the "Setting Up a Safe Analysis Environment" tutorial)
- Ransomware sample (use a known harmless sample for practice)
- Tools: IDA Pro, Ghidra, Process Monitor

## Steps

### 1. Initial Inspection
1. **File Properties**: Check the basic properties of the file (e.g., size, type, hashes).
   - On a terminal, use commands like `file` and `md5sum`:
     ```sh
     file sample.exe
     md5sum sample.exe
     ```

2. **VirusTotal Scan**: Upload the file to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) to get an initial assessment from multiple antivirus engines.

### 2. Static Analysis
1. **Disassemble the Code**: Use IDA Pro or Ghidra to disassemble the ransomware sample.
   - Identify the encryption routines and key generation methods.

2. **Extract Strings**: Use the `strings` tool to extract readable text from the binary.
   - Look for ransom notes, URLs, and email addresses.

### 3. Dynamic Analysis
1. **Process Monitor**: Use Process Monitor to track file system, registry, and process/thread activity.
   - Start Process Monitor before executing the ransomware.
   - Filter the results to focus on the ransomware process.

2. **Observe Encryption**: Execute the ransomware in the isolated environment.
   - Observe the encryption process and identify the affected files.

### 4. Analyze Ransom Note
1. **Ransom Note Delivery**: Identify how the ransom note is delivered to the user.
   - Look for file creation or modification activities related to the ransom note.

### 5. Document Findings
1. **Create a Report**: Document your findings, including encryption methods, key generation, and ransom note details.
2. **Screenshots and Logs**: Include screenshots of the tools and logs from your analysis.

## Conclusion
Analyzing ransomware helps in understanding its encryption methods and ransom demands. By following these steps, you can safely analyze ransomware in a controlled environment.
